# 4. Write a command that lists all of the .csv files found in the Data/ directory and stores that list in an object called “csv_files”
csv_files <- list.files(path = "./Data/", pattern = "\\.csv$", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)
print(csv_files)

# 5. Find how many files match that description using the length() function
num_csv_files <- length(csv_files)
print(num_csv_files)

# 6. Open the wingspan_vs_mass.csv file and store the contents as an R object named “df” using the read.csv() function
df <- read.csv("./Data/wingspan_vs_mass.csv")

# 7. Inspect the first 5 lines of this data set using the head() function
head(df, 5)

# 8. Find any files (recursively) in the Data/ directory that begin with the letter “b” (lowercase)
b_files <- list.files(path = "./Data/", pattern = "^b", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)

# 9. Write a command that displays the first line of each of those “b” files (this is tricky… use a for-loop)
for (file in b_files) {
  first_line_b_files <- readLines(file, n = 1)
  cat("File name: ", file, "\nFirst line: ", first_line_b_files, "\n")
}

# 10. Do the same thing for all files that end in “.csv”
for (file in csv_files) {
  first_line_csv_files <- readLines(file, n = 1)
  cat("File name: ", file, "\nFirst line: ", first_line_csv_files, "\n")
}
